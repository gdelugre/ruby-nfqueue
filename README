* Description of nfqueue

nfqueue is a tiny wrapper around libnetfilter_queue. It allows you to do some packet filtering very simply in a Ruby environment.

For example, plugging on the #0 queue:

require 'nfqueue'

system('sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0')

Netfilter::Queue.create(0) do |packet|
  puts "Inspecting packet ##{packet.id}"

  p packet.data
  Netfilter::Packet::ACCEPT
end


You basically need to have kernel support for NFQUEUE and libnetfilter_queue installed to get it working.


* Dependencies

nfqueue depends on ffi (https://github.com/ffi/ffi/wiki/)
